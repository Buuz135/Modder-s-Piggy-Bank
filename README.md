Modder's Piggy Bank is a tool that will allow players to see who made their favorite mods by showing a list of mods of a random mod author in the mincraft instance they are launching, with no extra configuration!

It will also allow mod authors to add their donation links. If you are a head to [this repository](https://github.com/Buuz135/Modders-Piggy-Bank-Repository) to know how to add them.
